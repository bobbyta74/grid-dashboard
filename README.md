# grid-dashboard
## Description
Dashboard I made using CSS grid as part of the Odin Project. The aim was to get something similar to [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png).

## Difficulties
- It was quite difficult to split the layout up into manageable parts without making the code too difficult to read (due to too many nested divs). This was hard especially in the header, which I decided to split horizontally, but then changed the division to vertical.
- I had trouble with responsive design and scaling the different sections for different viewport widths, but learned to use media queries to adjust the proportions of the side panels or snap them to the bottom.
- The *Your Projects* grid was confusing at first because I forgot how to use auto-fill. I reviewed the lesson and implemented it successfully.
- It took forever to get box-shadow to work.

## Things I learnt
- Using external icons [(Font Awesome)](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Media queries
- Box-shadow (again)
